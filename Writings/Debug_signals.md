# Debugging signals

![alt text](..\images\writings_image-28.png)

- The data from various subsystems is coming through port 1, and based the int value `Debug Signal`,

- The selected port has 2 values which are the indices the Selector block.

- The one which has $U$ and $Idx1_1$ and based U[Idx1_1] is sent out in the Y. 

- Since the data is 2 elements we demux it as `Debug_signal_1` and `Debug_signal_2`.
