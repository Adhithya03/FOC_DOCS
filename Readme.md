# Field the oriented control of Induction motor

This repository has various text files explaining, the field-oriented control example from Simulink's Motor Control Blockset. It breaks down the implementation of sensorless FOC for an induction motor using the F23879D Delphino launchpad. Each component is explained step by step to help understand the practical aspects of FOC implementation.

# About this page.

This repository documents my final year project on Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of induction motors, capturing the insights I gained despite hardware implementation challenges. The explanations here also form the basis of my YouTube tutorials, created to simplify and share FOC concepts with a wider audience.
